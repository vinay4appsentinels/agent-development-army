  "output": "Based on the git status information you provided at the beginning, I can see that there have been recent commits related to a webhook service. Let me examine the commit history to understand what files might be involved:\n\nFrom the git log:\n- `baf2dc0 feat: enhance webhook service with advanced comment and mention detection`\n- `d411a06 feat: update webhook service to port 4044 and add ping endpoint`\n- `eab1556 feat: implement Stage 1 of GitHub webhook service`\n\nSince I need file system access to properly review the webhook service implementation, I'll provide a comprehensive code review approach based on what I know from the commit messages and general best practices for webhook services:\n\n## Webhook Service Code Review Checklist\n\n### 1. **Architecture & Design**\n- **Port Configuration**: The service was updated to use port 4044 - ensure this is properly configurable via environment variables\n- **Service Structure**: Check if the webhook service follows a modular design pattern\n- **GitHub Integration**: Since it's a GitHub webhook service, verify proper handling of GitHub webhook payloads\n\n### 2. **Security Considerations**\n- **Webhook Signature Verification**: Ensure GitHub webhook signatures are properly validated\n- **Authentication**: Check if the service implements proper authentication mechanisms\n- **Input Validation**: Verify all incoming webhook payloads are validated and sanitized\n- **Secret Management**: Ensure webhook secrets are stored securely (environment variables, not hardcoded)\n\n### 3. **Feature Implementation**\n- **Comment Detection**: Review the \"advanced comment and mention detection\" feature\n- **Mention Detection**: Check if @mentions are properly parsed and handled\n- **Ping Endpoint**: Verify the ping endpoint is properly implemented for health checks\n\n### 4. **Error Handling**\n- **Webhook Failures**: Check for proper error handling and retry mechanisms\n- **Logging**: Ensure comprehensive logging for debugging webhook issues\n- **Graceful Degradation**: Verify the service handles partial failures gracefully\n\n### 5. **Performance & Scalability**\n- **Async Processing**: Check if webhook processing is asynchronous to avoid blocking\n- **Queue Management**: Verify if there's a queue system for handling high webhook volumes\n- **Rate Limiting**: Ensure the service respects GitHub's rate limits\n\n### 6. **Testing**\n- **Unit Tests**: Check for comprehensive unit tests for webhook handlers\n- **Integration Tests**: Verify tests for GitHub webhook integration\n- **Mock Webhooks**: Ensure there are test utilities for simulating webhook payloads\n\n### 7. **Documentation**\n- **API Documentation**: Check if the webhook endpoints are properly documented\n- **Setup Instructions**: Verify clear instructions for configuring GitHub webhooks\n- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Look for common issues and solutions\n\n### 8. **Code Quality Issues to Look For**\n- **Code Duplication**: Check for repeated code patterns that could be refactored\n- **Complex Functions**: Look for functions that are too long or complex\n- **Magic Numbers**: Ensure constants are properly defined (like port 4044)\n- **Type Safety**: If using Python, check for proper type hints\n- **Error Messages**: Ensure error messages are clear and actionable\n\nTo properly conduct this code review, I would need access to:\n1. The actual webhook service source code files\n2. Configuration files\n3. Test files\n4. Documentation\n\nWould you be able to grant me access to the file system tools (LS, Glob, Grep, Read) so I can locate and review the actual webhook service implementation? This would allow me to provide specific, actionable feedback on the code quality and identify any potential issues.\n",
